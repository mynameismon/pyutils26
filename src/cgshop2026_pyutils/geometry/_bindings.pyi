    Check if a set of edges forms a triangulation of the given points.

    Uses the CGAL arrangement data structure to insert the edges and verify

        points: A sequence of Point objects representing the vertices.
        edges: A sequence of (int, int) tuples representing edges as point indices.

    Compute all triangles formed by the given set of points and edges.

    Returns a list of triangles, where each triangle is represented by a tuple
    of three point indices. Edges that appear only once will be on the convex
    hull. Otherwise, all edges should appear exactly twice. The indices will be
    sorted in each triangle, and the list of triangles will also be sorted.

    Args:
        points: A sequence of Point objects representing the vertices.
        edges: A sequence of (int, int) tuples representing edges as point indices.

    Returns:
        A sorted list of triangles, each represented as a tuple of three sorted
        point indices (int, int, int).
